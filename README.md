# Tesla-Stock-Predictor-LSTM-RNN
## Overview

Keras based LSTM RNN Deep Learning implementation to predict Tesla Inc. stock prices.

## Requirements

  * Keras = 2.x (TensorFlow backend)
  * Numpy
  * Pandas
  * Quandle
  
## Details
  * This is a Time series forcasting implementation using LSTM based RNN Deep Learning Model.
  * All the training data is from Wiki/Tesla dataset from Quandl.com (A great source for financial datasets).

## Possible Improvements
  * Adding more variables instead of just one.
  * Trying GRU instead of LSTM.
  * Adding more training data.
